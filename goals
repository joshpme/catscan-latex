goals for today

add event id to conferences in refdb - done!


goal for sunday:

Fix bug with reference search:
doi:10.3204/PUBDB-2019-03613 not resolving even though this is a valid DOI

Extra 1000 references (with DOIs) from tex papers with their contents

Write a unit test against these references




invalid DOI check:
check if DOI exists

find if DOI exists for reference


not including: doi at the start of DOI URL:

E.g.

\bibitem{HDG}
	H. De Gersem, S. Vanaverbeke, and G. Samaey, "Three-dimensional–two-dimensional coupled model for eddy currents in laminated iron cores," \textit{IEEE Trans. on Magn.}, vol. 48, no. 2, pp. 815-818, Feb. 2012, doi: \url {10.1109/TMAG.2011.2172924}.


incorrect reference format:

E.g.
\bibitem{Takakura}
H. Takaki \emph{et al.},
\textquotedblleft{Beam injection with a pulsed sextupole magnet in an electron storage ring}\textquotedblright,
\emph{Phys. Rev. ST Accel. Beams} 13, 020705 (2010).


\bibitem{ESRF-Crosstalk}
Ga\"el Le~Bec, Jo\"el Chavanne, Simone Liuzzo, and Simon White.
\newblock Cross talks between storage ring magnets at the extremely brilliant
  source at the european synchrotron radiation facility.
\newblock {\em Phys. Rev. Accel. Beams}, 24:072401, Jul 2021.

Not wrapping the journal in \emph

\bibitem{Duodecuple} M. Sorbi, \textit{et al}, "Construction and Cold Test of the Superferric Dodecapole High Order Corrector for the LHC High Luminosity Upgrade," in IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity, vol. 29, no. 5, pp. 1-5, Aug. 2019, Art no. 4001905


URL is doi.org url

   \bib item{bdsim}
        L.~Nevay et al., "BDSIM: An accelerator tracking code with particle–matter interactions", \textit{Computer Physics Communications}, 252-107200, 2020 \url{doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2020.107200}.


Incorrect use of:
\begin{thebibliography}{99}   % Use for  10-99  references
%\begin{thebibliography}{9} % Use for 1-9 references



reference inside the abstract

tables have titles, and should be in title case with no period

numbers follow by common units need to use the special \~ half space character

figures in sentence case

more figures than are referenced

more tables than are referenced

more bibitems than are referenced
